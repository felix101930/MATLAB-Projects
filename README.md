# MATLAB Projects

## Overview
This repository contains projects focused on signal processing filters and digital control systems applied to rotational and translational mechanical systems. The projects aim to explore and demonstrate various techniques in signal processing and control systems design using MATLAB.

## Project Structure
- **Signal Processing Filters**: Implementations of various filters for signal processing tasks, including noise reduction and signal enhancement.
- **Digital Control Systems**: Designs and simulations of digital control systems for mechanical systems, focusing on both rotational and translational dynamics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- MATLAB installed on your machine.
- Required toolboxes for signal processing and control systems (e.g., Signal Processing Toolbox, Control System Toolbox).
